Mass Function Emulator
======================
This is a collection of the starting design for an emulator of quantities related to gravitational weak lensing. This includes the two point correlation function and mass overdensity, both of which can be generated from simulations.

This also contains code that allows for jackknifing a rectangular 3D region for mass function calculation.
